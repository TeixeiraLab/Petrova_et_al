This repository contains DNA-PAINT analysis codes designed for filtering non-specific binding events and unwanted localizations, as well as calculating distances between clusters. The code processes data generated by the DNA-PAINT technique, specifically addressing issues related to non-specific binding and unwanted localizations. Additionally, the scripts calculate distances between clusters, providing insights into spatial relationships within the analyzed data.
