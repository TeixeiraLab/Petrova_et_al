# Petrova_et_al

This repository contains DNA-PAINT analysis codes designed for filtering non-specific binding events and unwanted localizations, as well as calculating distances between clusters. The code processes data generated by the DNA-PAINT technique, specifically addressing issues related to non-specific binding and unwanted localizations. Additionally, the scripts calculate distances between clusters, providing insights into spatial relationships within the analyzed data.


# DNA-PAINT Cluster Analysis

This repository contains Python scripts for analyzing DNA-PAINT data, specifically focusing on filtering non-specific binding events, unwanted localizations, and calculating distances between clusters.

## Script Descriptions:

### `calculate_edge_distances(data)`

Calculates the edge distances between clusters in the given DataFrame.

- **Parameters:**
  - `data`: DataFrame containing cluster data.
- **Returns:**
  - DataFrame with columns: ClusterID, NearestClusterID, and EdgeDistance.

### `save_result_csv_and_plot(result_df, csv_file)`

Saves the result DataFrame to a new CSV file and plots the edge distances histogram.

- **Parameters:**
  - `result_df`: DataFrame with ClusterID, NearestClusterID, and EdgeDistance columns.
  - `csv_file`: Path to the input CSV file.
- **Returns:**
  - None

### `process_csv_files()`

Main function to process multiple CSV files and calculate edge distances.

- **Parameters:**
  - None
- **Returns:**
  - None

## Usage:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Place your CSV files in the same directory as the script.
3. Run the script using `python script_name.py` in the terminal.

The script will process each CSV file, calculate edge distances between clusters, save results in new CSV files, and generate histograms for edge distances.
